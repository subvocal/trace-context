# Other Communication Protocols

While trace context is defined for HTTP, the authors acknowledge it is also relevant for other communication protocols. Extensions of this specification, as well as specifications produced by external organizations, define the format of trace context serialization and deserialization for other protocols. Note that these extensions may be at a different maturity level than this specification.

Please refer to the [[!trace-context-protocols-registry]] for the details of trace context implementation for other protocols.
