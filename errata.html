        <h1>How to Submit an Erratum?</h1>
        <p>Errata are introduced and stored in the <a class="done" href="https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/issues/">issue list of the group‘s GitHub repository</a>. The workflow to add a new erratum is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>An issue is raised for a possible erratum. The label of the issue SHOULD be set to “<code>ErratumRaised</code>”. It SHOULD also include the label corresponding to the document on which the erratum is raised, i.e., “<code class="done">trace-context-1</code>”. (Please, consult the <a class="done" href="https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/labels">list of available labels</a>.) It is o.k. for an erratum to have several labels. In some, exceptional, cases, i.e., when the erratum is very general, it is also acceptable not to have a reference to a document.</li>
           <li>Issues labeled as “<code>Editorial</code>” are displayed separately, to make it easier to differentiate editorial errata from substantial ones.</li>
          <li>The community discusses the issue. If it is accepted as a genuine erratum, the label “<code>Errata</code>” is added to the entry and the “<code>ErratumRaised</code>” label should be removed. Additionally, a new comment on the issue MAY be added, beginning with the word "Summary:" (if such a summary is useful based on the discussion).</li>
          <li>If the community rejects the issue as an erratum, the issue should be closed.</li>
          <li>Each errata may be labelled as “<code>Editorial</code>”; editorial errata are listed separately from the substantial ones.</li>
<!--
          <li class="todo">ALL substantive errata are generally expected to have corresponding test(s) (such as a pull request in <a href='https://github.com/web-platforms-tests/wpt'>web-platforms-tests</a>), either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the erratum.</li>
-->
      </ul>

        <p>This report contains a reference to all open issues with the label <code>Errata</code>, displayed in the sections below. Each section collects the issues for a specific document, with a separate section for the issues not assigned to any.</p>
